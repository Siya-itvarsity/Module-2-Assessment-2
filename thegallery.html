            <p>The Gallery is a Johannesburg-based chain of stores present all over Southern Africa. The department store was previously selling clothing,shoes, homeware & beauty and under new leadership has recently shifted its focus to mass-market fashion and beauty products.

             The chain had just around 200 stores, with multiple locations in South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Botswana as well as in the capital cities of eSwatini (Swaziland), Lesotho, and Ghana when it was sold to Durban based, private fashion company Retailability in 2020.[1]</p>
